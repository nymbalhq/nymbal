Product listings, search, recently viewed and `GET /api/products/:slug` serve each product's `rating` (`{ average, count }`, or null with no approved review) from the reviews adapter; the native aggregate now counts every approved review. Product cards show the stars, average and count, `nymbal-review-list` takes a `rating` for its summary, and the product page's JSON-LD carries `aggregateRating`.
A scaffolded store copies `src/lib/seo.ts` and `src/pages/product/[slug].astro` (Astro) or `lib/seo.ts` and `app/(catalog)/product/[slug]/page.tsx` (Next.js, whose JSON-LD `url` now names `/product/<slug>`).
