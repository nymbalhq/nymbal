Back-in-stock alerts: `POST /api/alerts/subscribe` emails a confirmation, and `/api/alerts/confirm` and `/api/alerts/unsubscribe` take the token from its links. A variant whose stock rises from 0 publishes `product.restocked.v1`, and each confirmed subscriber gets one email. Adds the `alert_subscriptions` migration; subscribe is limited to 10 per IP per hour and answers 409 on a store whose email is `native`.
`GET /api/capabilities` reports `email.delivers`.
Breaking for a kernel composed by hand: `buildServices` now takes `email` (the email adapter), `registerHandlers` takes `alerts` (the alert service), and `registerCapabilitiesRoute` needs `adapters.email`.
