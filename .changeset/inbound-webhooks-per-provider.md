Any commerce adapter can take webhooks at `POST /api/webhooks/<providerName>` by implementing the optional `receiveWebhook(rawBody, headers)`; a delivery sent twice, even at once, is processed once. Its events must be named `<providerName>.<event>.v<n>` and listed in `producesEvents`, each payload a plain JSON object. `/api/webhooks/stripe` is unchanged.
`runWebhookContract` certifies an adapter's `receiveWebhook`, and `webhookDeliveryProblem` from `@nymbalhq/types` gives the rule both apply, the first reason a delivery is refused or null.
