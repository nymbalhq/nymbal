## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- f93dab3: The `native` search provider is full-text search in the store's own database: SQLite FTS5 on a SQLite store, a
  GIN-indexed `tsvector` on Postgres. Every match is reachable through cursor pages with an exact total.
  - Migration 0007 creates the search tables (`search_documents`, and on SQLite its FTS5 index). Run
    `nymbal migrate`. A store that had products before 0007 indexes them on its next start, from the warm-up replay.
  - `createNativeSearchAdapter({ sql, logger })` takes the command store's raw clients (`rawClients(store)`), not a
    document store. `BuildAdaptersDeps` takes `sql` in place of `documentStore`. The `search-index` document-store
    collection is no longer written.
  - Results are ranked: products with every query term in the name come first, then products with every term in the
    name, a SKU or a variant name, then the rest by the engine's score, then by id.
  - `search` pages by `cursor`. `nextCursor` is null on the last page, and `total` counts every match. A malformed
    cursor is an error, and a cursor past the last match is an empty last page. `encodeSearchCursor(offset)` is
    exported. `filters.categoryIds` narrows to a category, with filters applied as well as the query.
  - `FacetParams.query` is new: `facet('categoryIds', { query, filters })` counts the query's matches per category.
  - `GET /api/products/search` takes `category=<slug>` and answers `{ items, nextCursor, total, facets }`. `facets` is
    the category facet in the listing's shape (slug values, name labels) when search reports `facet` and the query
    matches. An unknown category gives no items and a total of 0. A malformed cursor is a 400.
  - The SDK's `products.search(query, { limit, cursor, category })` returns `total` and `facets`. The search store
    gains `loadMore()` and `setCategory(slug | null)`, and `SearchState` gains `category`, `nextCursor` and `facets`.
    Its `total` is now the API's total, not the number of results loaded. `useSearch` exposes the same.
  - `<nymbal-product-filter source="search">` (React: `ProductFilter source="search"`) renders the search's facets and
    narrows the search to the category chosen. Choosing the chosen category again clears it.
  - Both templates' `/search` show the API's total (`search-total`), a Load more button (`search-load-more`) while
    pages remain, and the category filter when the search has facets. The filter writes `?category=` beside `?q`.

  **Behaviour change in matching.** A query is split into terms: runs of ASCII letters and digits, lowercased.
  Everything else separates terms, and that includes non-ASCII letters. Each term must be a prefix of a word in the
  product's name, SKU, variant name or description. The old match was a substring anywhere in the product. So
  `ool` no longer finds "wool", `foo.bar` finds products with words starting `foo` and `bar`, a query with no terms
  finds nothing, and a match in a field other than these four (a slug, a price) no longer counts.

- ea74a39: The storefronts render from what the store's adapters can do, never from which vendor is configured.
  - `GET /api/capabilities` (public) answers the store's report: `payments` (`capabilities`, `client`), `search`
    (`capabilities`) and `catalog` (`sortKeys`, `defaultSort`). It names no provider and serves no secret.
    `StoreCapabilities`, `PaymentClient` and `PRODUCT_SORT_LABELS` are new in `@nymbalhq/types`. The SDK reads the
    report once per client with `client.capabilities.get()`.
  - A payments adapter may describe its storefront half with `client(): { driver, options } | null`, where `options`
    holds public values only. The native stub answers `{ driver: 'test-mode', options: {} }`. Stripe answers
    `{ driver: 'stripe', options: { publishableKey } }`, from the new `publishableKey` in its config or
    `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`; a key that starts `sk_` or `rk_` there fails at start.
  - `<nymbal-payment-element client='<json>'>` (React: `PaymentElement`) renders that client half through a driver
    from the SDK's registry (`registerPaymentDriver(name, driver)`, `getPaymentDriver(name)`), and its
    `confirm(clientSecret, context?)` answers `{ ok: true, confirmed }` or `{ ok: false, error }`. `context`
    (`PaymentConfirmContext`: `email`, `billing`) is the shopper's email and billing address, which both checkouts
    pass and the `stripe` driver sends as `billing_details`. `registerComponents()`
    registers the `test-mode` driver and a `stripe` driver that loads Stripe.js from js.stripe.com, so no project
    installs a Stripe package. A project registers a driver of its own in its client bootstrap; one registered under a
    built-in's name wins. A `null` client renders nothing; an unknown driver shows `payment-element-error`, and the
    checkout keeps Place Order disabled.
  - `<nymbal-sort-dropdown sort-keys value default-sort>` (React: `SortDropdown`) offers the store's sort keys in its
    order and emits `nymbal:sort:changed` with `{ sort }`.
  - Astro's listing script sorts on the dropdown's `nymbal:sort:changed`, so it sorts whichever select the element
    renders. On Astro's checkout, the second click of a double click on shipping Continue, which lands on Place Order,
    no longer places the order.
  - `GET /api/products` leaves out `facets` when the search adapter does not report `facet`. Both templates render the
    product filter only from the listing's facets, the header search bar only when search reports `search`, and the sort
    options from `catalog.sortKeys`.
  - `loadConfig()` returns the config module's named `adapters` export as `adapters`, and `nymbal dev` passes it to
    `createApp`, so a `custom` slot runs under `nymbal dev`.

  **Breaking for a Stripe store and for a scaffolded checkout.** The templates no longer import `@stripe/*`, read
  `PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` or `*_NYMBAL_PAYMENTS_PROVIDER`, and
  `nymbal dev` no longer sets the latter. Give the API the publishable key instead (`payments.config.publishableKey`
  or `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`). The payment step's test id is `payment-element` (was `stripe-card-element` on Astro and
  `card-element` on Next), and Next's `CheckoutForm` takes the report as its `capabilities` prop.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- e45d84d: First release under `@nymbalhq`: the libraries publish as `@nymbalhq/*`, the CLI as `nymbal` and the scaffolder as `create-nymbal-app`.
- 26fd94a: A checkout that completes. `POST /api/checkout` now answers the payment outcome (`payment: { status: 'succeeded' |
'requires_action' | 'failed', reason? }` and `orderStatus`). When the payments adapter captures at once, as the
  `native-stub` adapter now does, the order is confirmed, its stock committed and its cart emptied in the same request;
  Stripe orders are still confirmed by the webhook. The stub takes test triggers from the receipt email: a local part
  ending `+stub-pending` stays pending, `+stub-decline` fails. One cart has at most one pending order (migration `0005`,
  `orders.cart_token` with a partial unique index): a resubmit answers the same order, a changed cart cancels the old
  intent and supersedes its order (409 `checkout.payment_in_progress` when the provider refuses), an emptied cart
  answers 409 `checkout.cart_empty` naming the order it became, and a pending order left without an intent is
  abandoned after 120 s. A capture for a cancelled order, or one that cannot confirm its order, is refunded. The
  `order-placed` email is sent once per order on `order.paid`, not on `order.placed`, so an unpaid or imported order
  sends none.

  `PaymentsAdapter` gains `cancelPaymentIntent(intentId)` and `getPaymentIntent(intentId)`, and
  `PaymentIntentParams.receiptEmail`; a third-party adapter must implement both methods. In the SDK,
  `checkout.submitPayment()` resolves to the server's result (or `null`), `paymentStatus` is `succeeded` only when the
  server says so and `requires_action` while Stripe must confirm, `checkout.markConfirmed()` is new, and the cart store
  reloads after a submit. Both templates follow `payment.status`, and their order pages show the order's real state
  ("Awaiting payment" for a pending order).

- 97944c3: Every route the store serves now passes one security guard, however the store is started.

  **CSRF.** The Fastify adapter runs the guard on every route before auth and handler. A POST, PUT, PATCH or DELETE
  without a `nymbal.csrf` cookie and an equal `x-csrf-token` header answers 403 `csrf.invalid`, unless the route was
  registered with `csrf: false` (the Stripe webhook). `GET /api/csrf` returns the token in its body and sets the cookie.
  The SDK, the admin and both templates fetch it once and send the header, and refetch once on a `csrf.invalid`. The
  storefront and the API must be on the same site, as the cart cookie already requires.

  **Rate limits.** Built-in rules sit under `security.rateLimit`, and a configured rule for the same path replaces its
  default:
  - `/api/auth/login`: 10 failed attempts per 15 minutes, per IP and per account email. A successful login clears that
    account's count. A blocked login answers 429 `rate_limit.block` with `Retry-After`, even with the right password.
  - `/api/auth/register`: 10 per hour per IP.

  **Breaking:** `http.trustProxy` now defaults to `false`, so `X-Forwarded-For` is ignored. Behind a proxy or load
  balancer, set `http.trustProxy: true`, or every client shares the proxy's IP for rate limiting.

  **Roles.** Roles moved from `customers.metadata.roles` to a `customers.roles` column (migration 0004 backfills it with
  the known roles only). Tokens read the column alone, so writing `metadata` can no longer grant `admin`.
  `Customer.roles` is required.

  **Input validation.** Every platform route has a Zod schema in the exported `routeSchemas` registry, keyed
  `"<METHOD> <path>"`. A route without one refuses to register. Params, query and body are parsed before the handler, so
  unknown keys are stripped and bad input answers 400 `validation.failed` with `context.issues`.

  **Error statuses.** `ValidationError` answers 400. `CheckoutError` answers 409 for `cart_empty`, `out_of_stock` and
  `reservation_failed`, and 422 for `variant_missing`. `finalize_failed` stays 500.

- 07d451c: Sort works. `GET /api/products?sort=` takes `newest` (the default), `price-asc`, `price-desc`, `name-asc` or `name-desc`, ties broken by slug; an unknown key, or a cursor from another sort, answers 400. Breaking in the SDK: `productList.setSort(key)` takes a `ProductSortKey` instead of `(field, direction)`, `state.sort` is that key. `load(params)` defines the listing: its `sort` and `category` become the active ones, and a `load(params)` without `sort` resets the sort to `newest`; `load()` with no arguments reloads the current sort and category, and `setSort` and `loadMore` keep them. A response that arrives after a newer request is dropped. `QueryParams.orderBy` orders a document-store query without filtering it. Both templates offer the same five sorts, keep them in `?sort=`, and render that order on the server. Category facet counts on `GET /api/products` now always count the whole catalogue.
- e29919d: Honest storefront templates.
  - **SDK.** `client.customer.addresses.{list,create,remove}` and `client.customer.orders.{list,get}` call the account
    routes that exist, with the bearer token and the envelope unwrapped.
  - **Account pages.** Both templates' account pages now use these SDK calls, so a signed-in shopper sees their
    profile, addresses and orders. An order opens by its order number.
  - **Next.js template.** Sign Out revokes the session, a reload keeps a signed-in shopper signed in, and the account
    area can add an address.
  - **Search.** Choosing a search suggestion, by click or keyboard, opens the product on both templates.
  - **Upgrades.** The templates move to Astro 7 and Next 16 with React 19.
    - `@nymbalhq/react` now targets React 19 types: its peer range is `>=19`, and the generated JSX declarations augment
      `react` rather than the global namespace. That is breaking for React 18 consumers (pre-1.0, so a minor).
    - `nymbal dev` passes `--ignore-lock` to `astro dev`, so Astro 7 stays in the foreground when an AI agent runs it.
  - **Typecheck.** The root typecheck now runs `astro check`, and the scaffold is re-synced.
