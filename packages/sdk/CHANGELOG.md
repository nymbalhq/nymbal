### Minor Changes

- 454e12a: The checkout begin is never sent again without the shopper's token after a failed refresh (`RequestOptions.keepIdentity`), and the checkout store keeps the API's `errorCode` beside `error`.
- ec1e87b: Breaking for new stores: both storefront templates send a content security policy (`pagePolicy` in `lib/page-policy`), which refuses framing the store, http images and any third-party script, font, pixel, browser-side call or form target (analytics, chat, Google Fonts) until you add it there. `nymbal start` adds HSTS (https only), `nosniff`, `X-Frame-Options`, a `Referrer-Policy` and a minimal policy to any page that sets none.
  The shopper's access token now stays in page memory: `client.auth.restore()` brings the session back from the refresh cookie on each page load, guests send nothing, and requests made meanwhile wait for it. A token an earlier version left in `localStorage` is removed and its shopper stays signed in.
  A client built on `@nymbalhq/sdk/core`, as the Astro template's is, calls `resumeSession(client)` from `@nymbalhq/sdk/core` once per page load before its first request; a store that keeps its own older `lib/client.ts` must add it.
- 13a6b2d: Product listings, search, recently viewed and `GET /api/products/:slug` serve each product's `rating` (`{ average, count }`, or null with no approved review) from the reviews adapter; the native aggregate now counts every approved review. Product cards show the stars, average and count, `nymbal-review-list` takes a `rating` for its summary, and the product page's JSON-LD carries `aggregateRating`.
  A scaffolded store copies `src/lib/seo.ts` and `src/pages/product/[slug].astro` (Astro) or `lib/seo.ts` and `app/(catalog)/product/[slug]/page.tsx` (Next.js, whose JSON-LD `url` now names `/product/<slug>`).
- f2c9a19: Signed-in shoppers can review a product (`POST /api/reviews`, 10 an hour per IP): one review per product, pending moderation, verified when they bought it (event `review.submitted.v1`); a guest sees "Sign in to write a review". `GET /api/products/:id/reviews` no longer publishes customer or order ids, and `GET /api/capabilities` reports `reviews`, so a reviews provider without `submit` shows no form.
  Breaking for a reviews adapter or a kernel composed by hand: `ReviewSubmission` carries `author`, an adapter without `submit` rejects with `ReviewRefusedError`, and `buildServices` takes `reviews`. A scaffolded store copies `src/lib/reviews.ts` and `src/pages/product/[slug].astro` (Astro) or `lib/reviews.ts` and `app/(catalog)/product/[slug]/page.tsx` (Next.js).

### Patch Changes

- 853d563: Every package has a README on npm. `nymbal mcp` now passes on the name and version of the MCP host that connected, so proposals, carts and orders record that agent rather than a generic client.
  `create-nymbal-app` ends by naming where to report a problem.

## 1.5.0

### Minor Changes

- c778b26: Order links now expire (48 hours from checkout, 30 days from the email). After that the shopper enters their email,
  or asks for a new link. Signed-in shoppers go to their account's order page.

  Breaking: an order read with its key no longer returns `billingAddress`, phones or `customerId`, and `ShopperOrder`
  makes every field the confirmation page does not show optional.

- 439c2aa: The storefront client can be built from `@nymbalhq/sdk/core` plus the `@nymbalhq/sdk/ns/*` namespaces a page uses; the
  Astro template does so. A store's own element that reads `client.cart`, `client.checkout` or another store namespace
  imports its `@nymbalhq/sdk/ns/<name>` module.

## 1.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 295dab6: `<nymbal-notify-me>` (`NotifyMe` in `@nymbalhq/react`) shows the selected variant's back-in-stock form while it is out of stock; the SDK adds `client.adapter.alerts.subscribe()`.
  Breaking for a custom `CommerceAdapter`: add `alerts.subscribe({ email, variantId, kind })`.
- ff6559d: Order pages show the order's timeline (placed, paid, shipped, delivered, cancelled, refunds) with the new `nymbal-order-timeline` element (`OrderTimeline` in React). `GET /api/orders/:n` serves `timeline`, and `client.customer.orders.get` returns it as `ShopperOrder`.

  `GET /api/orders` and `GET /api/orders/:orderNumber` no longer serve `history`: read `timeline` instead. The admin order routes still serve it.

- 75989c8: Home and product pages show the shopper's recently viewed products with the new `nymbal-recently-viewed` element (`RecentlyViewed` in React, `client.recentlyViewed` in the SDK), kept under an HttpOnly `nymbal.visitor` cookie and moved to the customer at sign-in. `POST` and `GET /api/recently-viewed` have a built-in rate limit of 600 a minute per IP, which `security.rateLimit['/api/recently-viewed']` replaces; `nymbal replay --to recently-viewed` rebuilds the lists from the events log.

### Patch Changes

- 75989c8: Requests refused with an expired access token while a token refresh is in flight now wait for that one refresh and are sent again with the new token, rather than failing. A custom `FetchClient` whose `onUnauthorized` refreshes through the same client should pass `{ authRefresh: true }` on that request; an unmarked refresh that is refused is cut off after 10 seconds with the original 401.

## 1.3.0

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [0cfbcf2]
  - @nymbalhq/types@1.3.0

## 1.2.0

- The product-list store reports `loading: true` first, so a server-rendered grid keeps its cards until the store
  settles.

## 1.1.0

- `products.search(query, { limit, cursor, category })` returns `total` and `facets`; the search store gains
  `loadMore()` and `setCategory()`.
- `client.capabilities.get()` reads the store's capabilities; `registerPaymentDriver` adds a payment driver.

## 1.0.0

- Versioned with the other packages; no changes of its own.

## 0.2.0

- First release under `@nymbalhq`.
- Sends the CSRF token on every write, and refetches it once on `csrf.invalid`.
- `checkout.submitPayment()` resolves to the server's result, `paymentStatus` follows the server, and
  `checkout.markConfirmed()` is new.
- `client.customer.addresses` and `client.customer.orders` call the account routes.
- **Breaking:** `productList.setSort(key)` takes a `ProductSortKey`.
