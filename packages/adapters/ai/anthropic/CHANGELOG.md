# @nymbalhq/ai-anthropic

## 1.6.0

### Minor Changes

- d441055: `AiAdapter.chat(messages, { system, maxTokens })` on Anthropic and the new `@nymbalhq/ai-openai` (`config: { model, baseUrl? }`, any OpenAI-compatible server).
  A custom ai adapter must now add `chat()`; `nymbal test:contracts --package` certifies it.
  Each call makes one attempt within `timeoutMs` (60 s by default) and throws an `AdapterError` that never carries the key.
- 061bc68: `chat()` takes `tools` and a `signal` and answers `toolCalls`, and `chatStream()` streams the answer, on Anthropic and OpenAI. A custom ai adapter's `chat()` must now return `toolCalls` (`[]` when none).
  `@nymbalhq/ai-openai` sends `max_completion_tokens` to api.openai.com and `max_tokens` to any other host; `tokenField` in its config overrides it.
  Anthropic requests no longer go through `@anthropic-ai/sdk`, so `DEBUG=true` prints neither the key nor the conversation.

### Patch Changes

- 853d563: Every package has a README on npm. `nymbal mcp` now passes on the name and version of the MCP host that connected, so proposals, carts and orders record that agent rather than a generic client.
  `create-nymbal-app` ends by naming where to report a problem.

## 1.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 6c85536: Adapters are named by slot: `@nymbalhq/payments-stripe` (renamed from `@nymbalhq/adapter-stripe`), `@nymbalhq/email-smtp`
  (from `@nymbalhq/adapter-smtp`), `@nymbalhq/ai-anthropic` (from `@nymbalhq/adapter-anthropic`), `@nymbalhq/document-store-redis`
  (from `@nymbalhq/doc-store-redis`) and `@nymbalhq/document-store-postgres-jsonb` (from `@nymbalhq/doc-store-postgres-jsonb`).
  Breaking: replace each old name with its new one in your store's `package.json`; the old names are not loaded.

### Patch Changes

- f05e635: Any provider name loads `@nymbalhq/<slot>-<provider>`, or the package its block names with `package:` (`security`
  too), so a third-party adapter needs no Nymbal release; a mistyped provider gets "did you mean", not an install line.
  Breaking: write `documentStore: { provider: 'redis' }` for `documentStore: 'redis'`, and the same for `eventBus` and
  `media`.
  Breaking: `@nymbalhq/config` `KNOWN_INFRASTRUCTURE` is now `ADAPTER_CATALOGUE` and `COMMAND_STORES`; `@nymbalhq/platform`
  `PROVIDER_PACKAGES` and `importProviderPackage` are now `resolveChoice` and `importAdapterModule`; error code
  `config.security_adapter_unknown` is now `adapter.provider_unknown`.
- d2513b9: Adapters now version on their own and peer `@nymbalhq/types`; install an adapter by name, with no version to match.
