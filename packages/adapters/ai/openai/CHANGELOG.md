# @nymbalhq/ai-openai

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 071e340: The admin's assistant sends a customer's email, phone, street lines and postcode to the AI provider as placeholders (`[email-1]`) and shows you the real values; choose the fields in `agents.assistant.mask` (`[]` turns it off). `nymbal doctor` names the AI host and what it receives.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- d441055: `AiAdapter.chat(messages, { system, maxTokens })` on Anthropic and the new `@nymbalhq/ai-openai` (`config: { model, baseUrl? }`, any OpenAI-compatible server).
  A custom ai adapter must now add `chat()`; `nymbal test:contracts --package` certifies it.
  Each call makes one attempt within `timeoutMs` (60 s by default) and throws an `AdapterError` that never carries the key.
- 061bc68: `chat()` takes `tools` and a `signal` and answers `toolCalls`, and `chatStream()` streams the answer, on Anthropic and OpenAI. A custom ai adapter's `chat()` must now return `toolCalls` (`[]` when none).
  `@nymbalhq/ai-openai` sends `max_completion_tokens` to api.openai.com and `max_tokens` to any other host; `tokenField` in its config overrides it.
  Anthropic requests no longer go through `@anthropic-ai/sdk`, so `DEBUG=true` prints neither the key nor the conversation.

### Patch Changes

- 853d563: Every package has a README on npm. `nymbal mcp` now passes on the name and version of the MCP host that connected, so proposals, carts and orders record that agent rather than a generic client.
  `create-nymbal-app` ends by naming where to report a problem.
