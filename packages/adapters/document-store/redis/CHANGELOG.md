# @nymbalhq/document-store-redis

## 1.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 6c85536: Adapters are named by slot: `@nymbalhq/payments-stripe` (renamed from `@nymbalhq/adapter-stripe`), `@nymbalhq/email-smtp`
  (from `@nymbalhq/adapter-smtp`), `@nymbalhq/ai-anthropic` (from `@nymbalhq/adapter-anthropic`), `@nymbalhq/document-store-redis`
  (from `@nymbalhq/doc-store-redis`) and `@nymbalhq/document-store-postgres-jsonb` (from `@nymbalhq/doc-store-postgres-jsonb`).
  Breaking: replace each old name with its new one in your store's `package.json`; the old names are not loaded.

### Patch Changes

- f05e635: Any provider name loads `@nymbalhq/<slot>-<provider>`, or the package its block names with `package:` (`security`
  too), so a third-party adapter needs no Nymbal release; a mistyped provider gets "did you mean", not an install line.
  Breaking: write `documentStore: { provider: 'redis' }` for `documentStore: 'redis'`, and the same for `eventBus` and
  `media`.
  Breaking: `@nymbalhq/config` `KNOWN_INFRASTRUCTURE` is now `ADAPTER_CATALOGUE` and `COMMAND_STORES`; `@nymbalhq/platform`
  `PROVIDER_PACKAGES` and `importProviderPackage` are now `resolveChoice` and `importAdapterModule`; error code
  `config.security_adapter_unknown` is now `adapter.provider_unknown`.
- d2513b9: Adapters now version on their own and peer `@nymbalhq/types`; install an adapter by name, with no version to match.
