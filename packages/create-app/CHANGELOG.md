# create-nymbal-app

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 6571ce9: Provider SDKs leave the kernel. `@nymbalhq/platform` no longer depends on `stripe`, `@anthropic-ai/sdk` or
  `nodemailer`: each lives in its own package, `@nymbalhq/adapter-stripe`, `@nymbalhq/adapter-anthropic` and
  `@nymbalhq/adapter-smtp`, which the kernel imports only when `nymbal.config.ts` names its provider. A store that uses
  one installs it and its SDK (`npm install @nymbalhq/adapter-stripe stripe`); if it is missing, `createApp` fails with
  `adapter.package_missing` and prints that line for the package manager in use.

  **Breaking: the config only accepts providers it knows.** Each commerce slot's `provider` is now one of
  `KNOWN_PROVIDERS` (exported by `@nymbalhq/config`): payments `native` or `stripe`; email `native` (console) or `smtp`;
  ai `none` or `anthropic`; reviews, search, analytics, shipping and tax `native`; and `custom` for every slot. Any other
  string, which used to load and silently run the native stub, now fails `loadConfig` naming the slot and the providers
  it accepts. In particular:
  - `ai: { provider: 'native' }` is no longer accepted: use `ai: { provider: 'none' }`, which builds no AI adapter
    (`app.adapters.ai` is `null`, and the admin's AI route answers 503).
  - SMTP mail moves from `email: { provider: 'native', config: { transport: 'smtp', smtp } }` to
    `email: { provider: 'smtp', config: { smtp } }` plus `@nymbalhq/adapter-smtp` and `nodemailer`. The old form fails
    `loadConfig` instead of printing mail to the console.
  - The Anthropic key is read from `ai.config.apiKey`, falling back to `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.

  **`createApp(config, { adapters })`** takes a project's own adapter for any slot whose provider is `custom`. A `custom`
  slot with nothing injected, or an adapter injected for a slot that is not `custom`, fails with
  `adapter.custom_mismatch`. `nymbal dev` and `nymbal start` cannot inject adapters yet. In production the stub-payments
  refusal reads the resolved adapter, so an injected stub is refused and an injected real adapter starts.

  **Capabilities.** `capabilities` is now a method, `capabilities(): readonly string[]`, on every adapter, the document
  store, the event bus and `MediaStorage`; adapters written against the old `capabilities` array must become a function.
  `app.capabilities()` reports each slot's provider and its adapter's answer. The native payments stub no longer lists
  `webhook`, since it verifies no signature.

  The kernel no longer exports `createStripePaymentsAdapter` or `createAnthropicAiAdapter` (import them from the adapter
  packages), and `createNativeEmailAdapter` keeps only the console transport. A new project's config defaults ai to
  `none`, so a fresh store installs no provider SDK. The WooCommerce importer skips AI enrichment when the store has no
  AI provider.

### Patch Changes

- bda781a: Astro storefront forms submit once. Add address, profile save, login, register, place order and the review form go
  through `submitOnce(form, handler)` (`src/lib/submit-once.ts`), which ignores a submit while the previous one is in
  flight, so a double click or a second Enter makes one change (a double-clicked Save on the add-address form used to
  create two addresses). The button is disabled while the handler runs and re-enabled when it settles, unless the
  handler resolves `'leaving'` after setting `location.href`; a handler that throws or rejects releases the form. The
  profile and review handlers move from inline `<script>`s to `src/scripts/profile-form.ts` and
  `src/scripts/review-form.ts`.
- ebbfeec: The admin and the Astro account pages fit a phone. Below the `md` breakpoint (768 px) the admin sidebar is off-canvas:
  a menu button in the top bar (`data-testid="admin-nav-toggle"`, `aria-expanded`) opens it over the page, and choosing
  a link or tapping the backdrop closes it; `main` and the top bar drop their 240 px offset and the live ticker is
  hidden. The dashboard, order detail, product edit, customer profile and media grids stack on narrow screens. At `md`
  and up the admin is unchanged. The Astro account sidebar no longer widens the page on a phone (468 px at 412): its
  link row scrolls inside the column.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- e45d84d: First release under `@nymbalhq`: the libraries publish as `@nymbalhq/*`, the CLI as `nymbal` and the scaffolder as `create-nymbal-app`.
- 26fd94a: A checkout that completes. `POST /api/checkout` now answers the payment outcome (`payment: { status: 'succeeded' |
'requires_action' | 'failed', reason? }` and `orderStatus`). When the payments adapter captures at once, as the
  `native-stub` adapter now does, the order is confirmed, its stock committed and its cart emptied in the same request;
  Stripe orders are still confirmed by the webhook. The stub takes test triggers from the receipt email: a local part
  ending `+stub-pending` stays pending, `+stub-decline` fails. One cart has at most one pending order (migration `0005`,
  `orders.cart_token` with a partial unique index): a resubmit answers the same order, a changed cart cancels the old
  intent and supersedes its order (409 `checkout.payment_in_progress` when the provider refuses), an emptied cart
  answers 409 `checkout.cart_empty` naming the order it became, and a pending order left without an intent is
  abandoned after 120 s. A capture for a cancelled order, or one that cannot confirm its order, is refunded. The
  `order-placed` email is sent once per order on `order.paid`, not on `order.placed`, so an unpaid or imported order
  sends none.

  `PaymentsAdapter` gains `cancelPaymentIntent(intentId)` and `getPaymentIntent(intentId)`, and
  `PaymentIntentParams.receiptEmail`; a third-party adapter must implement both methods. In the SDK,
  `checkout.submitPayment()` resolves to the server's result (or `null`), `paymentStatus` is `succeeded` only when the
  server says so and `requires_action` while Stripe must confirm, `checkout.markConfirmed()` is new, and the cart store
  reloads after a submit. Both templates follow `payment.status`, and their order pages show the order's real state
  ("Awaiting payment" for a pending order).

- 22b4523: Scaffold from a clean machine. `create-nymbal-app` installs by default (also with `--yes`; `--no-install` skips it),
  seeds through `nymbal seed`, pins every Nymbal package to one exact version with `@nymbalhq/stack`, `overrides` and
  `pnpm.overrides`, records `packageManager`, `.node-version` and `engine-strict`, and generates a config that uses native
  payments. The mobile prompt is gone. `nymbal seed` migrates first and is safe to run twice, every command loads the
  project's `.env`, `nymbal build` runs the project's local framework binary outside the monorepo, and `nymbal dev`
  tells the storefront to skip Stripe unless the configured provider is `stripe`.
- 07d451c: Sort works. `GET /api/products?sort=` takes `newest` (the default), `price-asc`, `price-desc`, `name-asc` or `name-desc`, ties broken by slug; an unknown key, or a cursor from another sort, answers 400. Breaking in the SDK: `productList.setSort(key)` takes a `ProductSortKey` instead of `(field, direction)`, `state.sort` is that key. `load(params)` defines the listing: its `sort` and `category` become the active ones, and a `load(params)` without `sort` resets the sort to `newest`; `load()` with no arguments reloads the current sort and category, and `setSort` and `loadMore` keep them. A response that arrives after a newer request is dropped. `QueryParams.orderBy` orders a document-store query without filtering it. Both templates offer the same five sorts, keep them in `?sort=`, and render that order on the server. Category facet counts on `GET /api/products` now always count the whole catalogue.
- e29919d: Honest storefront templates.
  - **SDK.** `client.customer.addresses.{list,create,remove}` and `client.customer.orders.{list,get}` call the account
    routes that exist, with the bearer token and the envelope unwrapped.
  - **Account pages.** Both templates' account pages now use these SDK calls, so a signed-in shopper sees their
    profile, addresses and orders. An order opens by its order number.
  - **Next.js template.** Sign Out revokes the session, a reload keeps a signed-in shopper signed in, and the account
    area can add an address.
  - **Search.** Choosing a search suggestion, by click or keyboard, opens the product on both templates.
  - **Upgrades.** The templates move to Astro 7 and Next 16 with React 19.
    - `@nymbalhq/react` now targets React 19 types: its peer range is `>=19`, and the generated JSX declarations augment
      `react` rather than the global namespace. That is breaking for React 18 consumers (pre-1.0, so a minor).
    - `nymbal dev` passes `--ignore-lock` to `astro dev`, so Astro 7 stays in the foreground when an AI agent runs it.
  - **Typecheck.** The root typecheck now runs `astro check`, and the scaffold is re-synced.

### Patch Changes

- d12c7ec: The admin ships in the box: `nymbal dev` serves it at `/admin/`, create-nymbal-app's outro prints the admin credentials, a reload keeps the merchant signed in, and orders arrive live.
