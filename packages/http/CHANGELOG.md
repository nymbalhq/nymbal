# @nymbalhq/http

## 1.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 295dab6: Back-in-stock alerts: `POST /api/alerts/subscribe` emails a confirmation, and `/api/alerts/confirm` and `/api/alerts/unsubscribe` take the token from its links. A variant whose stock rises from 0 publishes `product.restocked.v1`, and each confirmed subscriber gets one email. Adds the `alert_subscriptions` migration; subscribe is limited to 10 per IP per hour and answers 409 on a store whose email is `native`.
  `GET /api/capabilities` reports `email.delivers`.
  Breaking for a kernel composed by hand: `buildServices` now takes `email` (the email adapter), `registerHandlers` takes `alerts` (the alert service), and `registerCapabilitiesRoute` needs `adapters.email`.
- 75989c8: Home and product pages show the shopper's recently viewed products with the new `nymbal-recently-viewed` element (`RecentlyViewed` in React, `client.recentlyViewed` in the SDK), kept under an HttpOnly `nymbal.visitor` cookie and moved to the customer at sign-in. `POST` and `GET /api/recently-viewed` have a built-in rate limit of 600 a minute per IP, which `security.rateLimit['/api/recently-viewed']` replaces; `nymbal replay --to recently-viewed` rebuilds the lists from the events log.

### Patch Changes

  - @nymbalhq/types@1.3.0
  - @nymbalhq/config@1.3.0

## 1.2.0

- Every response carries `x-correlation-id`, Fastify's own 404 and 400 included.
- CORS exposes `x-correlation-id` and `Idempotent-Replayed`.

## 1.1.0

- The listening line logs at debug.

## 1.0.0

- `stop()` ends open event streams and closes their connections, so stopping the store no longer hangs with the admin
  open.

## 0.2.0

- First release under `@nymbalhq`.
- Every route passes one CSRF and rate-limit guard before auth. **Breaking:** `trustProxy` defaults to `false`.
- Routes registered with `rawBody: true` keep the exact request bytes, for webhook signatures.
