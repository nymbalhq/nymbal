# @nymbalhq/adapter-stripe

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 421722f: `nymbal add <recipe>` puts a scaffolded store on a service in one command: `redis`, `postgres`, `s3` or `stripe`. It
  installs the packages with the project's package manager, writes the slot values into `nymbal.config.ts`, appends the
  variables the service reads to `.env.example`, checks the result loads, and prints what is left to do (each required
  variable still unset is listed as `set NAME in .env`).
  - The edit goes through the config's AST, so comments, order and every other key stay as they were. Secrets are written
    only as `env('NAME')` calls, and `env` is added to the `@nymbalhq/config` import when needed. The edited config is
    loaded before it is written, with the values in `.env` applied as `nymbal dev` applies them and a placeholder for
    every variable still unset that an `env()` call with no default names. A secret not yet set never blocks an add, and
    a default or a `.env` value is validated as it will run. Nothing connects to the service.
  - Re-running a recipe is a no-op. A value the developer chose (not the scaffold's default) is a conflict that changes
    nothing and names the path and both values; `--force` overwrites it. `--dry-run` prints the config change, the
    `.env.example` lines and the install line. `--no-install` fails with the install line when a package is missing.
  - Each recipe is data in the package it belongs to, `recipes/<name>.json` in the `Recipe` shape that `@nymbalhq/types`
    now exports: `@nymbalhq/doc-store-redis` ships `redis`, `@nymbalhq/media-s3` ships `s3`, `@nymbalhq/adapter-stripe`
    ships `stripe` and `@nymbalhq/platform` ships `postgres`. Each exports `./recipes/*`.
  - `@nymbalhq/platform` exports `installLine(packages, env, cwd)`, the install command the adapter loader names for a
    missing package.

- ea74a39: The storefronts render from what the store's adapters can do, never from which vendor is configured.
  - `GET /api/capabilities` (public) answers the store's report: `payments` (`capabilities`, `client`), `search`
    (`capabilities`) and `catalog` (`sortKeys`, `defaultSort`). It names no provider and serves no secret.
    `StoreCapabilities`, `PaymentClient` and `PRODUCT_SORT_LABELS` are new in `@nymbalhq/types`. The SDK reads the
    report once per client with `client.capabilities.get()`.
  - A payments adapter may describe its storefront half with `client(): { driver, options } | null`, where `options`
    holds public values only. The native stub answers `{ driver: 'test-mode', options: {} }`. Stripe answers
    `{ driver: 'stripe', options: { publishableKey } }`, from the new `publishableKey` in its config or
    `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`; a key that starts `sk_` or `rk_` there fails at start.
  - `<nymbal-payment-element client='<json>'>` (React: `PaymentElement`) renders that client half through a driver
    from the SDK's registry (`registerPaymentDriver(name, driver)`, `getPaymentDriver(name)`), and its
    `confirm(clientSecret, context?)` answers `{ ok: true, confirmed }` or `{ ok: false, error }`. `context`
    (`PaymentConfirmContext`: `email`, `billing`) is the shopper's email and billing address, which both checkouts
    pass and the `stripe` driver sends as `billing_details`. `registerComponents()`
    registers the `test-mode` driver and a `stripe` driver that loads Stripe.js from js.stripe.com, so no project
    installs a Stripe package. A project registers a driver of its own in its client bootstrap; one registered under a
    built-in's name wins. A `null` client renders nothing; an unknown driver shows `payment-element-error`, and the
    checkout keeps Place Order disabled.
  - `<nymbal-sort-dropdown sort-keys value default-sort>` (React: `SortDropdown`) offers the store's sort keys in its
    order and emits `nymbal:sort:changed` with `{ sort }`.
  - Astro's listing script sorts on the dropdown's `nymbal:sort:changed`, so it sorts whichever select the element
    renders. On Astro's checkout, the second click of a double click on shipping Continue, which lands on Place Order,
    no longer places the order.
  - `GET /api/products` leaves out `facets` when the search adapter does not report `facet`. Both templates render the
    product filter only from the listing's facets, the header search bar only when search reports `search`, and the sort
    options from `catalog.sortKeys`.
  - `loadConfig()` returns the config module's named `adapters` export as `adapters`, and `nymbal dev` passes it to
    `createApp`, so a `custom` slot runs under `nymbal dev`.

  **Breaking for a Stripe store and for a scaffolded checkout.** The templates no longer import `@stripe/*`, read
  `PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` or `*_NYMBAL_PAYMENTS_PROVIDER`, and
  `nymbal dev` no longer sets the latter. Give the API the publishable key instead (`payments.config.publishableKey`
  or `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`). The payment step's test id is `payment-element` (was `stripe-card-element` on Astro and
  `card-element` on Next), and Next's `CheckoutForm` takes the report as its `capabilities` prop.

## 1.0.0

### Minor Changes

- 6571ce9: Provider SDKs leave the kernel. `@nymbalhq/platform` no longer depends on `stripe`, `@anthropic-ai/sdk` or
  `nodemailer`: each lives in its own package, `@nymbalhq/adapter-stripe`, `@nymbalhq/adapter-anthropic` and
  `@nymbalhq/adapter-smtp`, which the kernel imports only when `nymbal.config.ts` names its provider. A store that uses
  one installs it and its SDK (`npm install @nymbalhq/adapter-stripe stripe`); if it is missing, `createApp` fails with
  `adapter.package_missing` and prints that line for the package manager in use.

  **Breaking: the config only accepts providers it knows.** Each commerce slot's `provider` is now one of
  `KNOWN_PROVIDERS` (exported by `@nymbalhq/config`): payments `native` or `stripe`; email `native` (console) or `smtp`;
  ai `none` or `anthropic`; reviews, search, analytics, shipping and tax `native`; and `custom` for every slot. Any other
  string, which used to load and silently run the native stub, now fails `loadConfig` naming the slot and the providers
  it accepts. In particular:
  - `ai: { provider: 'native' }` is no longer accepted: use `ai: { provider: 'none' }`, which builds no AI adapter
    (`app.adapters.ai` is `null`, and the admin's AI route answers 503).
  - SMTP mail moves from `email: { provider: 'native', config: { transport: 'smtp', smtp } }` to
    `email: { provider: 'smtp', config: { smtp } }` plus `@nymbalhq/adapter-smtp` and `nodemailer`. The old form fails
    `loadConfig` instead of printing mail to the console.
  - The Anthropic key is read from `ai.config.apiKey`, falling back to `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.

  **`createApp(config, { adapters })`** takes a project's own adapter for any slot whose provider is `custom`. A `custom`
  slot with nothing injected, or an adapter injected for a slot that is not `custom`, fails with
  `adapter.custom_mismatch`. `nymbal dev` and `nymbal start` cannot inject adapters yet. In production the stub-payments
  refusal reads the resolved adapter, so an injected stub is refused and an injected real adapter starts.

  **Capabilities.** `capabilities` is now a method, `capabilities(): readonly string[]`, on every adapter, the document
  store, the event bus and `MediaStorage`; adapters written against the old `capabilities` array must become a function.
  `app.capabilities()` reports each slot's provider and its adapter's answer. The native payments stub no longer lists
  `webhook`, since it verifies no signature.

  The kernel no longer exports `createStripePaymentsAdapter` or `createAnthropicAiAdapter` (import them from the adapter
  packages), and `createNativeEmailAdapter` keeps only the console transport. A new project's config defaults ai to
  `none`, so a fresh store installs no provider SDK. The WooCommerce importer skips AI enrichment when the store has no
  AI provider.
