## 1.7.0

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [071e340]
  - @nymbalhq/types@1.7.0

## 1.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 37d8f4a: Shipping adapters declare `rates`, `labels` and `tracking` and have only those methods (`rate`, `createLabel` and the new `startTracking` are optional; `track()` and `ShippingTracking` are removed; rate and label params and results are reshaped; native declares none), `GET /api/capabilities` reports `shipping`, and `runShippingContract` checks the words against the methods.
  A shipped order's tracking number is registered with a provider that declares `tracking`: `@nymbalhq/shipping-easypost` with an `apiKey` (which also rates and buys labels), or the new `@nymbalhq/shipping-aftership`.
  `store.shipFrom` sets the address the store ships from.
- d441055: `AiAdapter.chat(messages, { system, maxTokens })` on Anthropic and the new `@nymbalhq/ai-openai` (`config: { model, baseUrl? }`, any OpenAI-compatible server).
  A custom ai adapter must now add `chat()`; `nymbal test:contracts --package` certifies it.
  Each call makes one attempt within `timeoutMs` (60 s by default) and throws an `AdapterError` that never carries the key.
- 061bc68: `chat()` takes `tools` and a `signal` and answers `toolCalls`, and `chatStream()` streams the answer, on Anthropic and OpenAI. A custom ai adapter's `chat()` must now return `toolCalls` (`[]` when none).
  `@nymbalhq/ai-openai` sends `max_completion_tokens` to api.openai.com and `max_tokens` to any other host; `tokenField` in its config overrides it.
  Anthropic requests no longer go through `@anthropic-ai/sdk`, so `DEBUG=true` prints neither the key nor the conversation.
- f2c9a19: Signed-in shoppers can review a product (`POST /api/reviews`, 10 an hour per IP): one review per product, pending moderation, verified when they bought it (event `review.submitted.v1`); a guest sees "Sign in to write a review". `GET /api/products/:id/reviews` no longer publishes customer or order ids, and `GET /api/capabilities` reports `reviews`, so a reviews provider without `submit` shows no form.
  Breaking for a reviews adapter or a kernel composed by hand: `ReviewSubmission` carries `author`, an adapter without `submit` rejects with `ReviewRefusedError`, and `buildServices` takes `reviews`. A scaffolded store copies `src/lib/reviews.ts` and `src/pages/product/[slug].astro` (Astro) or `lib/reviews.ts` and `app/(catalog)/product/[slug]/page.tsx` (Next.js).

### Patch Changes

- afa9aac: The event bus handler-failure case checks that the other handlers finished before the publish settled by their order, not by how long it took, so it no longer fails an adapter on a busy machine.
- 853d563: Every package has a README on npm. `nymbal mcp` now passes on the name and version of the MCP host that connected, so proposals, carts and orders record that agent rather than a generic client.
  `create-nymbal-app` ends by naming where to report a problem.

## 1.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 965b85a: Email adapters can report bounces and complaints from `receiveWebhook` as `<provider>.bounced.v1` and
  `<provider>.complained.v1`; a hard bounce or a complaint stops alert mail to that address. Webhooks may be
  form-encoded or plain text. `runEmailFeedbackContract` certifies an email adapter's bounces and complaints.
- d9c8c5a: Shipping adapters can report tracking updates from `receiveWebhook` as `<provider>.tracking.v1`; a delivered update
  marks the shipped order delivered. `runShippingTrackingContract` certifies a shipping adapter's tracking updates.
  Breaking for a kernel composed by hand: `registerHandlers` takes `orders` (the order service).

## 1.4.0

### Minor Changes

- d724fd2: Breaking for event bus adapters: when a handler of a named subscription throws, `publish` now rejects with `adapter.handler_failed` (build it with `handlerFailedError`), once every matching handler has finished. Unnamed subscriptions are still only logged.
  The contract suite's throwing-handler delivery case now expects the rejection, and gains the handler-failure cases.
- 6f73872: Any commerce adapter can take webhooks at `POST /api/webhooks/<providerName>` by implementing the optional `receiveWebhook(rawBody, headers)`; a delivery sent twice, even at once, is processed once. Its events must be named `<providerName>.<event>.v<n>` and listed in `producesEvents`, each payload a plain JSON object. `/api/webhooks/stripe` is unchanged.
  `runWebhookContract` certifies an adapter's `receiveWebhook`, and `webhookDeliveryProblem` from `@nymbalhq/types` gives the rule both apply, the first reason a delivery is refused or null.
- d546cd3: Breaking: `createNativeAiAdapter` is removed; it threw on every call. Set `ai: { provider: 'none' }` or `'anthropic'` in its place.
  `runAiContract` and the `ai` kind of `nymbal test:contracts` are removed; test a custom AI adapter with your own suite.

## 1.3.0

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [0cfbcf2]
  - @nymbalhq/types@1.3.0

## 1.2.0

- First release: the suites every adapter passes (`run<Kind>Contract`, `contractSuites`), for certifying your own with
  `nymbal test:contracts --package`.
- The document store suite checks `replaceCollection`, so a third-party store must implement it.
